# EDA_Car
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

In this project, I have performed EDA on data set giving information of various cars users purchase and their features and price. The following models have been used and compared against each other:
1. Linear Model without regression
2. Linear Model with regression (Ridge Model)
3. SVM based Regressor
4. Decision Tree Regressor
5. Random Forest Regressor
6. Extra Trees Regressor
7. XGBoost or Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor
